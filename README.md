        abstract = {The discovery of causal relationships from empirical data is an important
problem in theory development. We investigate the use of TETRAD IV to help
researcher in a theory development phase. We applied TETRAD IV, a heuristic
search software that used for discovering causal effect relationship between
variables based on a specific model. To performed our task, we defined two case
studies. First, we re-analyse an existing model or theory using original
correlation matrix data from a paper in Knowledge Sharing field. Second, we
validated the existing model by conducting a survey using data from 90
respondents (Bachelor, master, PhD candidate) in the University of Twente
academic setting, which pointed out Blackboard as the primary online learning
tools to support teaching as well as sharing the knowledge. The results give us
suprising remarks. From the first case study, TETRAD IV discovered spurious
relationship in the model, which are there is no causal effect between its
variables. Furthermore, using our own data, we found the same results of causal
linkage as we have in the first case study. These results give the idea of what truly
occurs given the real data. Thus, it is critical to explore the relationships among
the variables in the model using exploratory research tools, as TETRAD IV, to aid
and guide the researcher in theory development phase.},
